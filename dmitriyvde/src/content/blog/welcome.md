## Hi, I'm Dmitriy, nice to meet you

This is my first post on my new GitHub pages site. I don't know why you're here,
or why you're reading this, but I'm glad you are. I hope you'll enjoy the content
I'll be posting here. My goal is to post mosly informative content about development,
but I might post some other stuff as well.

## What is this?

This site will be a tryout to see if creating written content is something for me.
I've dabbled in creating content in various other forms before, but never anything
blog-style like this. I do enjoy writing, or rather, I enjoy typing, and I also like
teaching people things, so I thought this would be a good way to combine these things.

## Who am I?

I'm currently a junior dev at [Cognit](https://www.cognit.be/) primarily working
on [Involv Intranet](https://www.involv-intranet.com/) an intranet solution built
on SharePoint using SPFx. I graduated from [Odisee](https://www.odisee.be/) with
a bachelor's degree in Electronics-ICT and also have an educational bachelor's
degree, which means I can also teach at secondary school level. I have taught
some programming in JavaScript and C# ASP.Net Core in higher education which I
really enjoyed. I might actually go teach at a school in the future, but for now
I wanted to imporve my skills as a developer.

## Which tools am I using?

I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
to generate the site and the [Terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal)
theme to make it look nice. I might change it in the future since I'm still learning
how to use Hugo and everything around it, but for now, I like it.
